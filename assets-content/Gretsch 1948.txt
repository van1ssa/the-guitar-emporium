Gretsch
Synchromatic X75F Acoustic (1948)
$3,995.00

Ah Gretsch; did they have one of the best guitar designers in the world or what?  Their distinctive design features tell you exactly what you’re looking at. For instance, the bridge on this old ‘40’s Synchromatic X75F looks so cool as does the triangular sound hole! (How did they come up with that idea?) The shield logo on the headstock is pretty neat and just the whole perspective of this guitar, looks perfect!  Other features include a flat top with an arched back, tortoise pickguard, double-bound body and binding on the neck.  Playing-wise, it doesn’t disappoint either!  It has a fat, but very comfortable neck with a 7 ¼” radius, plays real nice, has a great bassy tone and the notes ring out with lots of clarity.  It displays lots of cool body checking, some player wear and tear and mild chips and dings. (I guess if you were 74 years old, you might look the same?)  All the binding is original and intact and there’s some tell-tale glue signs around the tongue on the body top so it possibly may have had a neck reset at some stage, which is good news for an old Gretsch. This is one good-lookin’ guitar, and apparently, Hank Williams played one in the early days! Comes with it’s original, and super-cool, tweed Gretsch case.
