Beltona
Beltona Standard Triple Resonator (1994)
$4,995.00

Loud and sweet with wonderful projection; no wonder the name is made up from the words “Bell” and “Tone”; it says it all! This small company doesn't make a lot of these, in fact they may not make them at all anymore, so they are very hard to find. Quality is amazing and condition is very good with a couple of worn areas (see pics) but it’s been played and loved and not abused. It has a fantastic V shape neck. A beautiful English-made tricone instrument with a great-sounding metal body.  Comes with Hiscox case.
