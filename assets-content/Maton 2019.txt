Maton
EMBW-12 Mini Maton 12 String (2019)
$1,750.00

This is a lovely small guitar with a big sound plugged in courtesy of the AP5 pickup system, and this one comes with an extra six strings for free! Itâ€™s a great sounding unit, featuring some beautiful Australian blackwood, the neck is nice and wide, filling the hand but thin enough to not feel bulky. Other than some light arm wear on the upper bout this guitar is in top notch condition as well!  The nut has been changed to swap the strings around, like a Rickenbacker, but the original nut is in the case.  Comes with OHSC
