Larrivee
OM-03-MH (2011)
$3,995.00

This beautiful Canadian-built Larrivee commands you to play it the second you open the case!  All mahogany-made, and being a limited edition, it features lovely earthy tones in both the colours and sound. Gibson-style tuners and a comfortable body size all make this so appealing to play. This is an organic, light-feeling and throaty sounding guitar and it’s in great, unplayed condition in fact, it still has that new guitar smell!  If you’re looking for a gorgeous high-end acoustic that’s has something a little bit different to offer, this is a great choice!  Condition is excellent.  Comes with its original hard shell case.
