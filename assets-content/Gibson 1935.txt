Gibson
Tenor Guitar TG-50 (1935)
$3,495.00

I had a very pleasant surprise picking this one up to have a play. The sound was ultra-pleasing to my ears with a “piano-like” tone that I just didn’t expect from this guitar!  A lovely tight, crisp but full tone emanates out of this old thing and not only that, it’s a joy to play with its very small “V” shape neck and a great set-up too! Within a few minutes I had a fully-written instrumental that reminded me of early Led Zeppelin acoustic stuff!  This guitar took me somewhere else and gave me some unexpected inspiration, it may do the same for you.  Tenor guitars are few and far between it seems so if you’re looking for a cracker, look no further, here it is.  Comes with a hard shell case.
